Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with writing some code for your audio project. ðŸ˜Š

Here is a possible function that uses `setValueCurveAtTime` to perform an equal power cross fade between two audio source buffer nodes. It assumes that the nodes are already connected to a gain node and that the buffer and the fade duration are given as parameters. It also uses a helper function to create an equal power curve array, based on [this answer](^2^).

```javascript
// Create an equal power curve array
function equalPowerCurve (length, fadeType) {
  var curve = new Float32Array (length);
  var index = 0;
  var x = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
    x = i / length;
    if (fadeType === 'fadeOut') {
      index = length - i;
    } else if (fadeType === 'fadeIn') {
      index = i;
    } else {
      throw 'Invalid fade type';
    }
    curve[index] = Math.cos (x * 0.5 * Math.PI);
  }
  return curve;
}

// Perform an equal power cross fade between two audio source buffer nodes
function crossFade (buffer, fadeDuration) {
  var currentTime = context.currentTime;
  var curveLength = 100; // Adjust this as needed
  var fadeOutCurve = equalPowerCurve (curveLength, 'fadeOut');
  var fadeInCurve = equalPowerCurve (curveLength, 'fadeIn');

  // Create two source nodes from the same buffer
  var source1 = context.createBufferSource ();
  var source2 = context.createBufferSource ();
  source1.buffer = buffer;
  source2.buffer = buffer;

  // Connect the source nodes to the gain nodes
  source1.connect (gainNode1);
  source2.connect (gainNode2);

  // Set the initial gain values
  gainNode1.gain.setValueAtTime (1, currentTime);
  gainNode2.gain.setValueAtTime (0, currentTime);

  // Schedule the cross fade using setValueCurveAtTime
  gainNode1.gain.setValueCurveAtTime (fadeOutCurve, currentTime, fadeDuration);
  gainNode2.gain.setValueCurveAtTime (fadeInCurve, currentTime, fadeDuration);

  // Start the source nodes at the same time
  source1.start (currentTime);
  source2.start (currentTime);

  // Stop the source nodes after the fade duration
  source1.stop (currentTime + fadeDuration);
  source2.stop (currentTime + fadeDuration);
}
```

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š

That's a good question. The function I wrote is a simple example of how to use `setValueCurveAtTime` to crossfade between two buffers. It assumes that the buffer contains the entire audio segment that you want to play, and that you want to crossfade from the beginning to the end of the buffer.

However, if you want to crossfade between a source that is already playing and a buffer that contains the next segment, you need to modify the function a bit. Here are some possible steps:

- Create a new source node from the buffer and connect it to a new gain node.
- Get the current playback time of the source that is already playing using `source1.getCurrentTime()`.
- Calculate the remaining time until the end of the buffer using `buffer.duration - source1.getCurrentTime()`.
- Schedule the crossfade using `setValueCurveAtTime` for both gain nodes, starting from the current time and ending at the current time plus the fade duration.
- Start the new source node at the current time and stop it at the current time plus the remaining time.
- Stop the source that is already playing at the current time plus the fade duration.

Here is a possible code snippet that implements these steps:

```javascript
// Create a new source node from the buffer and connect it to a new gain node
var source2 = context.createBufferSource ();
var gainNode2 = context.createGainNode ();
source2.buffer = buffer;
source2.connect (gainNode2);
gainNode2.connect (context.destination);

// Get the current playback time of the source that is already playing
var currentTime = source1.getCurrentTime ();

// Calculate the remaining time until the end of the buffer
var remainingTime = source1.buffer.duration - currentTime;

// Schedule the crossfade using setValueCurveAtTime for both gain nodes
gainNode1.gain.setValueCurveAtTime (fadeOutCurve, currentTime, fadeDuration);
gainNode2.gain.setValueCurveAtTime (fadeInCurve, currentTime, fadeDuration);

// Start the new source node at the current time and stop it at the current time plus the remaining time
source2.start (currentTime);
source2.stop (currentTime + remainingTime);

// Stop the source that is already playing at the current time plus the fade duration
source1.stop (currentTime + fadeDuration);
```

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. ðŸ˜Š
