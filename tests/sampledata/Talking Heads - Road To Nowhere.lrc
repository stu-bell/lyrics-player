[ti: Road To Nowhere]

[00:00.55] Well, we know where we're goin'
[00:03.95] But we don't know where we've been
[00:08.23] And we know what we're knowin'
[00:12.78] But we can't say what we've seen
[00:18.44] And we're not little children
[00:21.79] And we know what we want
[00:26.82] And the future is certain
[00:30.54] Give us time to work it out
[00:36.03] 
[00:46.88] We're on a road to nowhere
[00:50.45] Come on inside
[00:54.83] Takin' that ride to nowhere
[00:58.43] We'll take that ride
[01:03.18] I'm feelin' okay this mornin'
[01:07.36] And you know
[01:11.65] We're on a road to paradise
[01:16.97] Here we go, here we go
[01:22.05] 
[01:26.82] We're on a ride to nowhere
[01:33.81] Come on inside
[01:38.21] Takin' that ride to nowhere
[01:41.84] We'll take that ride
[01:46.56] Maybe you wonder where you are
[01:51.72] I don't care
[01:55.32] Here is where time is on our side
[01:59.93] Take you there, take you there
[02:05.31] 
[02:11.51] We're on a road to nowhere
[02:17.96] 
[02:20.57] We're on a road to nowhere
[02:28.32] We're on a road to nowhere
[02:35.24] 
[02:38.34] There's a city in my mind
[02:40.23] Come along and take that ride
[02:42.29] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[02:46.25] And it's very far away
[02:48.59] But it's growing day by day
[02:50.64] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[02:54.99] Would you like to come along?
[02:57.87] And you could help me sing this song
[03:00.08] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:03.58] They can tell you what to do
[03:06.50] But they'll make a fool of you
[03:08.73] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:12.47] There's a city in my mind
[03:14.36] Come along and take that ride
[03:16.86] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:20.31] And it's very far away
[03:23.14] But it's growing day by day
[03:25.02] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:30.07] Would you like to come along?
[03:32.41] You could help me sing this song
[03:33.95] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:37.88] They can tell you what to do
[03:40.23] But they'll make a fool of you
[03:42.49] And it's all right, baby it's all right
[03:48.85] We're on a road to nowhere
[03:54.76] We're on a road to nowhere
[04:01.54] 
[04:05.41] We're on a road to nowhere
[04:10.29] 
[04:14.38] We're on a road to nowhere
