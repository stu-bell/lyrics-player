[ti: If I Could Turn Back Time]

[00:08.91] If I could turn back time
[00:13.16] If I could find a way
[00:17.58] I'd take back those words that have hurt you
[00:22.30] And you'd stay
[00:26.17] I don't know why I did the things I did
[00:30.30] I don't know why I said the things I said
[00:34.93] Pride's like a knife, it can cut deep inside
[00:38.81] Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
[00:46.01] I didn't really mean to hurt you
[00:50.58] I didn't wanna see you go
[00:52.70] I know I made you cry, but baby
[00:55.85] If I could turn back time
[01:00.05] If I could find a way
[01:04.85] I'd take back those words that have hurt you
[01:09.36] And you'd stay
[01:11.38] If I could reach the stars
[01:15.52] I'd give 'em all to you
[01:20.22] Then you'd love me, love me
[01:23.33] Like you used to do
[01:28.28] (If I could turn back time)
[01:30.73] My world was shattered, I was torn apart
[01:34.80] Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
[01:39.12] When you walked out that door
[01:40.43] I swore that I didn't care
[01:43.18] But I lost every thing, darlin', then and there
[01:49.67] Too strong to tell you I was sorry
[01:54.75] Too proud to tell you I was wrong
[01:57.19] I know that I was blind, and darlin'
[02:00.03] If I could turn back time
[02:04.47] If I could find a way
[02:09.37] I'd take back those words that have hurt you
[02:13.65] And you'd stay
[02:15.43] If I could reach the stars
[02:19.95] I'd give 'em all to you
[02:24.54] Then you'd love me, love me
[02:27.50] Like you used to do, ohh
[02:34.67] If I could turn back time
[02:37.17] (If I could turn back time)
[02:39.21] If I could turn back time
[02:42.08] (If I could turn back time)
[02:43.45] If I could turn back time, ohh baby
[02:52.68] 
[02:56.51] I didnt really mean to hurt you
[03:01.13] I didn't wanna see you go
[03:03.31] I know I made you cry
[03:05.47] But ohh
[03:06.49] If I could turn back time
[03:10.79] If I could find a way
[03:15.49] I'd take back those words that have hurt you
[03:19.72] If I could reach the stars
[03:23.93] I'd give them all to you
[03:28.48] Then you'd love me, love me
[03:31.35] Like you used to do
[03:35.14] If I could turn back time
[03:38.30] (Turn back time)
[03:41.59] If I could find a way (Find a way)
[03:46.32] Then maybe, maybe, maybe you'd stay
[03:53.48] (Reach the stars)
